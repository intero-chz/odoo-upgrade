A command line tool to upgrade your `Odoo <https://www.odoo.com>`_ database
using the `Upgrade API <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/9.0/reference/upgrade_api.html>`_
documented on the `official Odoo documentation <https://www.odoo.com/documentation>`_ (`v9.0 page
<https://www.odoo.com/documentation/9.0/reference/upgrade_api.html>`_)

It's the equivalent of filling the form on the `Upgrade platform <https://upgrade.odoo.com>`_ page.

It allows to:

* create a database upgrade request
* upload a database dump
* ask to process it
* obtain the current status of your request
